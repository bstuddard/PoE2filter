## **QUICK START:**

This is an "ItemFilter" - a script for the game Path of Exile 2 (not PoE1!). It highlights valuable items, and enhances gameplay comfort and experience.
This is *NOT* a hack/mod. It written using the official POE filter domain language. This script is based on NeverSink's Filter.

This is a barebones filter, with the idea to subtly enhance default in-game cosmetics and call-to-actions. 

## **IMPORTANT: MUST READ:**

1) This is a new and experimental filter, it has WAY less polishing and is not even comparable in scope to other POE filters. Tread with caution and please provide feedback! 
2) The filters from this GitHub project do NOT auto-update.
